The NP Registry serves as the root of addressability and trust for all network participants. It maintains comprehensive details such as the participant’s globally unique identifier (ID), network address (Beckn API URL), public key, operational domains, and assigned role (e.g., BAP, BPP, CDS). In addition to managing participant registration, authentication, authorization, and permission control, the Registry oversees participant verification, activation, and overall lifecycle management, ensuring that only validated and authorized entities can operate within the network.

You can publish your registries at [DeDi.global](https://publish.dedi.global/).

### For a Network Participant

#### Step 1 :  Claiming a Namespace

To get started, any platform that has implemented Beckn Protocol MUST create a globally unique namespace for themselves.   
All NPs (BAPs, BPPs, CDS’es) **MUST** register as a user on dedi.global and claim a unique namespace against their FQDN to become globally addressable. As part of the claiming process, the user must prove ownership of the namespace by verifying the ownership of their domain. Namespace would be at an organisation level. You can put your organisation name as the name of the namespace.

#### Step 2 :  Setting up a Registry

Once the namespace is claimed, each NP **MUST** create a Beckn NP registry in the namespace to list their subscriber details. While creating the registry, the user **MUST** configure it with the [subscriber schema](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/nirmalnr/a6e5b17522169ecea4f3ccdd831af7e4/raw/7744f2542034db9675901b61b41c8228ea239074/beckn-subscriber-no-refs.schema.json). Example of a registry name can be `subscription-details`.

#### Step 3 :  Publishing subscriber details

In the registry that is created, NPs **MUST** publish their subscription details including their ID, network endpoints, public keys, operational domains and assigned roles (BAP, BPP) as records.

### Step 4 :  Share details of the registry created with the Beckn One team

Once the registry is created and details are published, the namespace and the registry name of the newly created registry should be shared with the beckn one team.

### For a Network facilitator organization

#### Step 1 :  Claiming a Namespace

An NFO **MAY** register as a user on dedi.global and claim a unique namespace against their FQDN. As part of the claiming process, the user must prove ownership of that namespace by verifying the ownership of that domain. The NFO name can be set as the name of the namespace. 
*Note: A calibrated roll out of this infrastructure is planned and hence before it is open to the general public NFOs are advised to share their own domain and the domains of their NPs to the Beckn One team so that they can be whitelisted which will allow the NPs to verify the same using TXT records in their DNS.*

#### Step 2 :  Setting up a Registry

Network facilitators **MAY** create registries under their own namespace using the [subscriber reference schema](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/nirmalnr/a6e5b17522169ecea4f3ccdd831af7e4/raw/b7cf8a47e6531ef22744b43e6305b8d8cc106e7b/beckn-subscriber-reference.schema.json) to point to either whole registries or records created by the NPs in their own namespaces.  Example of a registry name can be `subscription-details`.

#### Step 3 :  Publishing subscriber details

In the registry that is created, NFOs **MAY** publish records which act as pointers to either whole registries or records created by the NPs records. The URL field in the record would be the lookup URL for a registry or a record as per DeDi protocol.

Example: For referencing another registry created by an NP, the record details created would be:

```json
{
  "url": "https://.dedi.global/dedi/lookup/example-company/subscription-details",
  "type": "Registry",
  "subscriber_id": "example-company.com"
}
```

Here `example-company` is the namespace of the NP, and all records added in the registry is referenced here. 

If only one record in the registry needs to be referenced, then the record details created would be:

```json
{
  "url": "https://.dedi.global/dedi/lookup/example-company/subscription-details/energy-bap",
  "type": "Record",
  "subscriber_id": "example-company.com"
}
```

Here `energy-bap` is the name of the record created by the NP in this registry. Only that record is referenced here.

#### Step 4 :  Share details of the registry created with the Beckn One team

Once the registry is created and details are published, the namespace and the registry name of the newly created registry should be shared with the beckn one team.
